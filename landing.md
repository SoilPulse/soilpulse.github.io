We're happy to be part of the EGU General Assembly 2024. Especially because such a gathering of scientist always raises the urge to share data - and almost always brings a little dissapointment afterwards because it's either impossible or paid-off by the immense price of spending countless hours on restructuring the data to 'fit in'.

But SoilPulse is here to change this (or at least we'll try)! Machine-generated and human-supervised framework for metadata generation is here to change the way you think about 'meta' in your data.

Come and see the **poster in session EOS4.7** - Sharing data, tools, and knowledge: resources and initiatives

**SoilPulse – A software package for semi-automated metadata management and publication**

Or join us for the **PICO at session SSS2.2** - Modelling soil erosion process from crop fields to hillslope: trends and perspectives under global change

**SoilPulse – Towards FAIR soil process data!**

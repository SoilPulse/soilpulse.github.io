### Why and where we are @EGU24
We're happy to be part of the EGU General Assembly 2024. Especially as such a gathering of scientists always fuels the urge to share data - and almost always comes with a bit of disappointment afterwards, as it's either impossible or comes at the immense cost of spending countless hours restructuring the data to 'fit in'.

But SoilPulse is here to change that (or at least we're trying)! A machine-generated and human-supervised metadata generation framework is here to change the way you think about the 'meta' in your data.

Come and see the **poster in session EOS4.7** - Sharing data, tools, and knowledge: resources and initiatives

**SoilPulse – A software package for semi-automated metadata management and publication [download presentation](assets/downloads/EGU_2024_poster.pdf)**

Or join us for the **PICO at session SSS2.2** - Modelling soil erosion process from crop fields to hillslope: trends and perspectives under global change

**SoilPulse – Towards FAIR soil process data! [download presentation](assets/downloads/SoilPulse_EGU2024_JL.pdf)**
